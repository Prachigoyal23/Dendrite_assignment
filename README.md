In the Step-1 file , The Python code implements a machine learning pipeline using scikit-learn. It parses a JSON file containing experiment details and builds a pipeline for data preprocessing, model selection, and hyperparameter tuning. The pipeline handles numerical features with scaling and missing value imputation (mean/custom value), encodes categorical features, and uses GridSearchCV with RandomForestRegressor (customizable) to find the best model configuration. An example demonstrates parsing a JSON file and building the pipeline, but the code for data loading, training, and prediction needs to be added separately.

In the step-2 file,
