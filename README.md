In the Step-1 file , The Python code implements a machine learning pipeline using scikit-learn. It parses a JSON file containing experiment details and builds a pipeline for data preprocessing, model selection, and hyperparameter tuning. The pipeline handles numerical features with scaling and missing value imputation (mean/custom value), encodes categorical features, and uses GridSearchCV with RandomForestRegressor (customizable) to find the best model configuration. An example demonstrates parsing a JSON file and building the pipeline, but the code for data loading, training, and prediction needs to be added separately.

In the step-2 file, The Python code defines a function handle_missing_values that reads a CSV file, identifies missing values, and imputes them based on a chosen strategy ("mean", "median", or "most_frequent"). It first reads the CSV data into a DataFrame and prints a summary of missing values. It then creates a SimpleImputer object for flexibility (though separate imputers for numerical/categorical data are recommended). The imputation strategy is applied, and an error message is displayed if an invalid strategy is used. The function returns the DataFrame with missing values imputed. An example demonstrates how to use the function with your CSV file path and desired strategy.

In the Step-3 file, The Python code defines a function data_preprocessing_pipeline that performs data preprocessing in a single step. It loads the CSV data, optionally creates new features through feature engineering (replace the example with your logic), and handles missing values using the handle_missing_values function from before. The function identifies the data types (numerical/categorical) and imputes missing values accordingly ("mean" or "median" for numerical, "most_frequent" for categorical). It incorporates error handling for invalid strategies and returns the preprocessed DataFrame. An example demonstrates how to use the function with your CSV file path and imputation strategy.

In the Step-4 file, The Python code defines a machine learning pipeline configurable through JSON. It creates scikit-learn models (LogisticRegression or RandomForestClassifier for classification in this example) based on the prediction type specified in a JSON file. The code also performs data preprocessing (replace the placeholder with your model-specific steps) and provides a full pipeline function that loads data, preprocesses it, creates a model from JSON, and includes placeholders for training and prediction logic specific to the chosen model. An example demonstrates how to use the pipeline with your data and JSON configuration file.

In the Step-5 file, The Python code constructs a machine learning pipeline with hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV. It creates models (LogisticRegression or RandomForestClassifier for classification in this example) based on a JSON configuration file. The create_model_from_json function parses the JSON, sets up hyperparameter grids for the chosen model, and performs GridSearchCV to find the best model configuration. It then returns the trained model. The data_preprocessing_pipeline
 loads data, performs model-specific preprocessing (replace the placeholder with your steps), and optionally handles categorical variables for classification models. The full_pipeline function combines these steps, loading the JSON configuration, preprocessing data, splitting it into training and testing sets (assuming labels), but the code snippet stops before training and prediction (which you'll need to implement based on your model). This framework lets you configure models and hyperparameters through JSON, automates hyperparameter tuning, and provides a foundation for building machine learning models with customizable preprocessing.
